	<h2>Our Goal</h2>
	<p align="left">
		back in the day computers were people who repeatedly performed very difficult math calculations. Now it is one of the things you are sitting in front of ;) . It was created to well, do those hard calculations for one and save a crazy amount of time. And 	now? It takes up a lot of the time of our daily life for example social media etc. well we aren't here to solve that problem but we are making the computerusage fast again. No longer search for that, opening that, no just say it and it happens. No typing, just speaking.
