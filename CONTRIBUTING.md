### Code Standards

- Comments:

Consider adding comments to explain complex logic or functions. While your function and variable names are descriptive, comments can provide additional clarity.

- Constants/Global viaraibles:
  
Move repeated constants at the beginning of your script. This makes it easier to update them in one place.

- Exception Handling: 

Consider handling exceptions more specifically in your functions.
